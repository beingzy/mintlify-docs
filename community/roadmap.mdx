### Communication & Engagement Principles

1. **Transparency & Regular Updates**
   Aim to share quarterly roadmap snapshots and monthly status summaries with key metrics, progress, and challenges — with flexibility to adjust timing or format as needed.

2. **Co-creation & Community Voice**
   Encourage feedback loops (polls, suggestion rounds) to inform priorities, and invite community members into ideation sessions — with the understanding that roadmaps may shift with evolving needs.

3. **Recognition & Incentivization**
   Highlight top contributors through badges, spotlights, or grants; use these as aspirational goals, knowing the reward structure may evolve based on community input.

4. **Learn & Onboard Continuously**
   Provide tutorials, walkthroughs, and task bounties to new participants. Refine the onboarding flows over time based on usability feedback and community behavior.

5. **Responsive & Adaptive Communication**
   When issues arise, we aim to respond timely with what we know, explain next steps, and update the community as facts evolve — recognizing that not all details are final at first.

## Why This Matters

* We aim to **build in public**, where transparency fosters trust, invites constructive feedback, and holds us accountable to our community.
* We view **token holders, contributors, and participants** as **stakeholders** — like shareholders — and believe visibility helps align incentives, deepen commitment, and elevate long-term thinking.
