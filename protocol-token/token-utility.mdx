## Summary

**Codatta** is a decentralized knowledge protocol, powering human-intelligence marketplace.
**`$XNY`** acts as the network’s operating currency—enabling **on-chain actions**, **staking-based trust**, 
**task launches**, **data/API access**, and **ownership trades**—while **contributor payouts** can be made in 
a mix of payout options where **XNY** is the **main reward currency**, while also supporting **stablecoins** 
(e.g., **USDT/USDC**) and **highly-liquid tokens** (e.g., **BTC/ETH**).

## Roles at a Glance
* **Providers:** Boost reputation by staking **$XNY** to access premium tasks of data sourcing and/or labeling; earn multi-asset payouts; receive royalties from data re-use.
* **Validators:** Build reputation by staking **$XNY** to increase the credibility of validation decisions; earn validation fees and dispute rewards; risk slashing for inaccuracy or misconduct.
* **Backers:** Stake to underwrite contributor cohorts or datasets; share in creator earnings/royalties; face penalties if quality standards or SLAs aren’t met.
* **Clients:** Launch tasks, access data/APIs, and license or trade ownership; use **$XNY** for task launches, access, priority, and rights management.


## Network Economics
* **`$XNY` Demand Drivers:** Every core network function (launch, access, ownership, priority, governance) requires `$XNY`.
* **Flexible Settlement:** Contributor earnings can be in stablecoins, majors, or partner tokens, lowering adoption friction.
* **Value Anchoring:** `$XNY` retains its core role as the **access, trust, and rights currency** of the ecosystem.


## FAQ (concise)
**1. Why use `$XNY` if payouts are multi‑asset?**
$XNY controls access, trust, rights, and governance. Multi‑asset payouts reduce buyer friction and meet cost‑management/compliance constraints (including stablecoin‑only settlement when required), while keeping $XNY as the network’s control and fee currency.

**2. Can Clients pay entirely in stablecoins?**
Yes—for contributor rewards. **$XNY** is still required for launch, access, licensing, and disputes.

**3. Who bears slashing risk?**
Contributors and disputing parties that post stake/bonds. Slashing enforces quality and honesty.

**4. How do royalties work?**
When licensed data is reused (e.g., in model training), smart contracts distribute ongoing payouts to eligible Contributors and Backers.

**5. Is this compliant for regulated Clients?**
Yes. Privacy proofs and compliance fees are paid in **$XNY**; audit logs and revocable licenses align with sector requirements.
