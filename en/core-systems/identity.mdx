title: Identity
description: "How contributors, teams, and agents are identified, verified, and bound to actions—without overexposing privacy."

<Info>
**What “identity” means here.**  
Identity is the link between an actor and their actions: signing **Contribution Fingerprints (CFs)**, staking, accessing datasets, and receiving payouts. An identity can be a **wallet**, a **DID**, an **organization/team identity**, or an **agent** acting on behalf of a human/team.
</Info>

## Identity primitives
Wallet address (secp256k1/ed25519), W3C **DID**, Organization/team identity with delegated keys, and **Agent identity** for autonomous agents (see [ERC-8004: Trustless Agents](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004) for an on-chain registry approach to agent **Identity/Reputation/Validation**). A person may link multiple wallets; a team may use multisig or delegated keys.

## Verification levels (progressive trust)
We support a ladder of assurance so contributors choose the minimum needed for their work:
- **Pseudonymous:** proves control of a key. Default for most contributions.
- **Linked accounts:** optional links (email, GitHub, ORCID) for continuity and recovery.
- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs):** third-party attestations (e.g., license, affiliation) for expert tasks.
- **KYC/KYB:** legal identity for regulated datasets or specific payout policies.

> Higher levels unlock work that requires stronger assurances and can increase reputation weight. Lower levels preserve privacy for open tasks.

## Enrollment & linking
Create an identity → link wallets → (optional) connect accounts → add VCs/KYC if needed → set payout address.  
You can **rotate keys** (lost/compromised) or delegate to agents—history is preserved, and new actions reference the updated keys.

## Signing & binding CFs
Every CF is **signed by exactly one identity** at creation (teams can use multisig/delegation). An **aggregator** may co-sign batched commits for efficiency. Verifiers check the signature, then the anchor.

## Privacy modes & selective disclosure
Pseudonymity is the default. Policies can require specific claims (e.g., “licensed clinician”) without revealing raw **PII**, using **verifiable credentials** and **encrypted artifacts** in Evidence & Signals. Sensitive payloads stay encrypted; only policy-authorized parties can decrypt.

<Tip>
**Experimental**: 
Anonymous credentials and zero-knowledge proofs for selective disclosure are on the roadmap; exact formats may change.
</Tip>

## Identity and Reputation
**Verification level**, **past accuracy**, and **staking-as-confidence** flow into your **reputation**. Stronger identities can unlock higher-impact work; slashing/penalties (if any) tie back to the same identity.

## Policy boundaries
Identity attributes (role, VC, KYC) map into **Access Gateway** rules (RBAC/ABAC). For the full policy language and metering details, see **Access Control & Metering**.

## Security practices
Use hardware wallets for high-value operations; enable 2FA/TOTP on dashboards; apply least-privilege keys for agents; follow a rotation/compromise playbook.

## Invariants (must hold)
- **CFs are signed:** every CF binds to one identity; rotations don’t change past signatures.
- **Minimal disclosure:** reveal only what policy requires; proofs live in Evidence & Signals when possible.
- **Auditability:** identity changes (links, rotations) are logged; history is append-only.

## Interfaces
- **To CF:** signing at creation; author metadata.
- **To Reputation:** verification level and history influence scores.
- **To Access/Metering:** identity attributes evaluated by the gateway.
- **To Royalty:** payout addresses and eligibility policies.
