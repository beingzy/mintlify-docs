A fast, shared language for anyone building or using Codatta.


## 1) Mental model: Atomic Contribution → Data Asset → Dataset

![Metal Model](/diagrams/data_hierachy.png)

### Atomic Contribution
A single, verifiable unit of work:

- **Sample** — a digital observation (image, audio, text, sensor stream, etc.).
- **Label** — structure or semantics applied to a sample (class, bbox, polygon, caption, event).
- **Validation** — a quality check on a sample or label (accept/reject/score/evidence).

Each atomic contribution is anchored by a **Contribution Fingerprint (CF)** and linked to a portable identity and lineage.

### Data Asset (the unit of ownership & licensing)
A **bounded bundle** of related atomic contributions (e.g., sample + accepted labels + validations).

- This is what buyers license and what royalties are calculated on.
- Validators’ value is attached to the asset they validated (no orphan validations).

### Dataset (a curated collection)
A named, versionable selection of **data assets** for a particular model/task.

- Datasets can be public or policy-gated and can be re-materialized over time.

## 2) Roles

### Knowledge Contributors
Provide **samples** and **labels**. They receive attribution via CFs and fractional ownership in the assets that include their work.

### Knowledge Validators
Review samples/labels with audits, re-labels, or evidence checks. Their reward is attached to the **assets** they validate (or merged into those assets once accepted).

### Data Users
License assets/datasets for training, fine-tuning, or evaluation. They obtain policy-gated access, generate **usage receipts**, and trigger **royalty payouts** based on actual consumption.

---

## 3) Ownership & royalty vocabulary

### Ownership token
Fractional rights over a **Data Asset**. Current holders receive payouts when that asset is used under a license.

### Royalty Router
On-chain logic that splits incoming revenue **pro-rata** to ownership token holders (and protocol share) using the asset’s policy and the latest ownership snapshot.

### License & Policy Registry
Where permitted uses are defined (scope, term, visibility, commercial/non-commercial).

- Licenses mint short-lived **access tokens** (or compute tickets) to read/use data.
- Policies control visibility (public vs. restricted), required validation level, and minimum royalty terms.

## 4) Short glossary

- **CF (Contribution Fingerprint)** — Tamper-evident identifier for each atomic contribution (and composite asset), linking identity, payload hash, evidence, and lineage.
- **Lineage** — The graph of how contributions and assets derive from or relate to each other; enables attribution and royalty inheritance.
- **DID (Decentralized Identity)** — Portable, user-controlled identity used for attribution, auth, and payouts.
- **Usage receipt** — A signed record of consumption (reads, batch training, evaluations) that triggers pricing and payouts.
- **TNPL (Train-Now, Pay-Later)** — A licensing mode where usage is metered first, then settled; reduces upfront costs for data users.
- **Access token / compute ticket** — Time-boxed capability to decrypt data or run privacy-preserving compute (e.g., in a TEE).
- **Evaluation log** — Append-only record of validation outcomes (evidence, score, reviewer identity).
- **Public vs. Restricted labels** — Visibility modes; public labels invite crowd validation, restricted labels require policy-gated access.
- **SaC (Staking-as-Confidence)** — Contributors/validators can stake on correctness; slashing/consensus aligns incentives and improves trust.
