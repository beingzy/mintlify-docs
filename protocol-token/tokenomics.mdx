### How to read the buckets (by groups)

* **Community (46.0%)** = **“Ecosystem Incentives — Strategic” + “Ecosystem Growth — Builder Grants” + “Node Incentives” + “Airdrop”**
* **Foundation (28.0%)** = **“Team” + “Advisor Incentives” + “Protocol Development”**
* **Market readiness (11.5%)** = **“Listing Reserve” + “Liquidity Provision”**
* **Fund-raising (14.5%)** = **“Investors” + “IDO Participatio.”** 

### Unlocks & governance (light)

</Card>

* **Unlocks** follow the published schedule (cliffs + linear vests per pool).
* **Incentive emissions** are program-based and disclosed at launch.
* Any **changes** require **governance approval** and **transparent** updates.

### Principles
* **Usage → distribution**: real work earns incentives.
* **Earned, not dumped**: team/advisors vest; programs pay for measurable contribution.
* **Market health first**: listing/liquidity are for access, not speculation.
